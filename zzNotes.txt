1.2. What Is TypeScript & Why Should You Use It

TypeScript:
  it is a programming language build on JS but it's also a tool
  it is powerful compiler which we run over the code to compile TS code to JS code.

atlast TS is JS with advance features. thus complex JS code can be written easier with help of TS.
Ts adds one important thing to JS ie types (thus, the name TypeScript).thus, before we get 'runtime errors' in browser, we will get to know beforehand.
